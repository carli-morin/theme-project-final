      <b>Brock Wyatt Holt</b> (born June 11, 1988) is an American professional baseball second baseman, shortstop and outfielder for the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB). While primarily used as an infielder, he has started in and played at every position for the Red Sox, except for pitcher and catcher. Listed at 5 feet 10 inches (1.78 m) and 180 pounds (82 kg), Holt bats left-handed and throws right-handed. He first played in MLB for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2012, but has played for the Red Sox since 2013, and was selected to represent them in the 2015 MLB All-Star Game. Holt has twice hit for the cycle, and is the only player in MLB history to do so in a postseason game.
